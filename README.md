# Matthew Devonport

Hey! :wave: I'm Matt - currently a freelance website/software developer who has started his own digital agency to help small-medium sized businesses operate online. I come from a strong sales & customer service background in the workforce, although have always had a massive interest in the tech scene. 

Early in 2019 I decided to pursue a career change into tech by studying at Dev Academy in Wellington New Zealand where I developed a passion for software development. I come from a background where I have thoroughly enjoyed building relationships with people, solving problems and finding solutions. This in combination with now creating applications to help people solve problems and find solutions in the tech world makes me feel confident that I am on my dream career path.
